## vacation

Inspired by a tweet from [@mixonic](https://twitter.com/mixonic/status/638138156718686209), `vacation` is a program to auto-ignore all watched repos on Github by running `vacation leave`. You can then revert your subscription statuses back by running `vacation return`. 

### Rationale

Couldn't this be easily done by disabling both Web and Email notifications?

Yes, but who doesn't love building things? Plus, it gave me a reason to learn `octokit`.
